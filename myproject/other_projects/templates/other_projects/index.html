<h1>Other Projects</h1>
<p>This where I am holding other (non web-based) projects.</p>
<p>This website is recent (Summer 2016), so I have yet to find all of my past projects, many of them buried throughout various hard drives, but I hope this will be a way of storing them.</p>
<p>You can download them and have a look at them yourself:</p>
<ul>
	{% for project in project_list %}
		<li><a href="{% url 'other_projects:download_project' project.id %}"> {{ project.project_name }}</a></li>
	{% endfor %}
</ul>

{% endblock %}
